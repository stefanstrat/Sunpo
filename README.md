# Sunpo

Building an Android application to locate the user on the planet, and specify the Sun's position on the sky relative to the phone's physical location.

This is a personal summer project by which I hope to familiarize myself with very simple Android development, and learn more about the operating system.

As this is the first Android application I will write, the code quality will most likely be sub-par. The bar is set very low with this one.
